# Heinrich Glarean's _Dodekachordon_
This repository contains chapters out of [Heinrich Glarean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Glarean)'s _Dodekachordon_ (1547). The Latin text is based on the [transcription](https://chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/16th/GLADOD1_TEXT.html) by the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum (prepared by Sean Ferguson, Charles Atkinson, Bradley Jon Tucker, and Thomas J. Mathiesen and hosted by the University of Indiana), as well as the [Freiburg speciment](http://dl.ub.uni-freiburg.de/diglit/glareanus1547), which includes a number of handwritten marginalia. The available chapters have been marked up according to the [TEI](https://tei-c.org/) XML specification. 

This repository is part of a [university project](https://github.com/umj95/Glarean) designed to try out various modes of presentation of an Early Modern musicological text. One of the stated goals of this project is it to make the text available both in its Latin original and a translation. Therefore, this repository also contains translations of the text into German, which I have provided myself in order to test the concept. Note that – at this stage – both the Latin and German texts exist purely as a proof of concept and should NOT be used as the basis of scholarly enquiery!

At the moment the project of which this repository forms a part is maintained only by me and development is dictated by how much time I can invest into it at any given moment. Should the texts provided here be at some stage in a shape that would make them usable for actual work, I will indicate it in this README. In theory, I would also like to use this project as a testing ground for a GitHub centered editing workflow. At the moment, I cannot in good conscience encourage anyone to engage with this project, as there are no guidelines or workflows in place, but I am planning on expanding on this in the future. So if you are interested in discussing anything related to this topic, feel free to open an issue here!
